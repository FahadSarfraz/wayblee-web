# Terms and Conditions of Use

<br>

## 1. APPLICABILITY OF THE GTCU

The General Terms and Conditions of Use (hereinafter the “GTCU”) are proposed by SARFRAZ FAHAD (hereinafter the “Company”). The Company is the owner and publisher of the Wayblee mobile App (hereinafter the “mobile App”).

The purpose of these GTCU is to define all the terms and conditions according to which the Company allows Users to use the Mobile App (hereinafter the “Users”).

They therefore apply to any use of the Mobile App. The User declares to have read and accepted these GTCU before any use of the Mobile App.

Prior to the entry into force of any new terms and conditions, the Company shall inform Users by any appropriate means of the entry into force of any new provisions. If the User does not express any objections within one (1) week, the amendments proposed by the Company shall be considered as having been accepted by the User.

Acceptance of these GTCU assumes on the part of Users that they have the necessary full legal capacity or, if not, have received permission from a legal guardian if they lack such capacity, or have received permission from their legal representative if they are minors, or hold a representation mandate if they are acting on behalf of a legal entity.

If the Company chooses not to enforce any provision of these GTCU at a given time, this cannot be interpreted as a waiver of any provision of the GTCU at a later time.

If certain stipulations of the GTCU are unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, including because of an applicable law or regulation, the Parties shall remain bound by the other stipulations of the GTCU and shall endeavour to remedy the unenforceable clauses in the same spirit in which they were entered into.

<br>

## 2. USER ACCOUNT

Before any use of the features of the Mobile App, the User must first create a personal account on the Mobile App.

When requesting the opening of a User account, the User must provide information about his/her identity as requested on the registration form. If the User provides inaccurate or obsolete registration data, the Company shall be entitled to refuse to create an account or to suspend any accepted account temporarily or permanently. In particular, the User undertakes to refrain from creating a false identity likely to mislead the Company or third parties or impersonating another person. The User undertakes to immediately update the data initially communicated in case of modifications.

The User shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of his/her Mobile App login identifiers. The User must inform the Company immediately of any unauthorised use of his/her identifiers. The Company cannot be held liable for any loss or damage resulting from the User’s proved negligence in protecting his/her login identifiers and/or the personal information related to his/her account.

Once the User has registered on the Mobile App, he/she shall be assigned an account, materialised by a page containing a profile and a profile editing page from which he/she can manage his/her information.

<br>

## 3. OBLIGATIONS OF USERS

The User undertakes to comply with all provisions of these GTCU.

The User agrees to use the Mobile App for strictly personal use. In this regard, the User shall not:

* Use the Mobile App unlawfully, for any unlawful purpose, or in any manner inconsistent with these GTCU.
* Post content contrary to law and order and good morals (in particular, advocating for crimes against humanity, inciting racial hatred, child pornography, etc.);
* Post content not authorised by the Company,
* Publish commercial solicitations or unwanted content (“spam”) from the Mobile App,
* Post contents infringing the property rights, particularly intellectual property rights, of third parties.
* Sell, copy, reproduce, rent, lend, distribute, transfer or grant a sub-license for all or part of the contents appearing on the Mobile App, or decompile, extract, disassemble, modify, display in a form readable by the User, attempt to discover any source code, or use any software activating or including all or part of the Mobile App.
* Attempt to obtain unauthorised access to the Mobile App’s computer system or engage in any activity disrupting, decreasing the quality or interfering with the performance, or deteriorating the features of the Mobile App.
* Use the Mobile App for abusive purposes by voluntarily introducing viruses or any other malicious program and attempt to gain unauthorised access to the Mobile App.
* Infringe the Company’s intellectual property rights.
* Denigrate the Mobile App and/or the Products as well as the Company on social networks and any other means of communication.

If, for any reason, the Company believes that the User fails to comply with these GTCU, the Company may, at any time and at its sole discretion, eliminate the User’s access to the Mobile App and take all measures, including any civil and criminal legal action, against the User.

## 4. POSTS
When posting on the Mobile App, the User must comply with these GTCU and any instructions and policies posted on the Mobile App by the Company. The Company also reserves the right to set a storage limit, communicated to the User, regarding contents that can be hosted on the Mobile App.

The content and account of any User who fails to comply with the GTCU or instructions given by the Company may be deleted.

Posts on the Mobile App are listed and ranked randomly and/or chronologically or according to the choices and filters selected by any User from his/her account. The Company does not receive any remuneration likely to influence or change the listing of posts.

<br>

## 5. RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANY
The Company shall be responsible towards the Users for the proper fulfilment of the obligations resulting from these GTCU. The Company may not be held responsible for any breach of these GTCU attributable to the User, to a third party to this contract, or to any event beyond its control that could not reasonably be expected.

As part of the simple provision of access to the Mobile App, the Company merely acts as a technical service provider and may not in any case be held responsible for acts of use or exploitation of the Mobile App by the User or committed using the User’s identifiers.

The Company shall make every effort to ensure uninterrupted access to the Mobile App but can in no case be held liable if the User cannot gain access to the Mobile App in case of unavailability related to maintenance operations or the failure of the Internet network or for any other reason outside its control. The User shall remain fully responsible for the security of his/her equipment (computers, telephone, tablet, software, means of telecommunication, etc.) permitting access to the Mobile App, which remains the exclusive responsibility of the User in the same way as expenses incurred by use of telecommunications.

The Company also shall not bear any responsibility for the content or any other element hosted on the Mobile App and/or the Application and posted by Professionals where the Company has not been previously and effectively notified of their clearly unlawful nature by means of a notification in accordance with the provisions of Article 6.I.5 of French Law 2004-575 for confidence in the digital economy.

Lastly, the Company may not be held responsible for any breach of any of its contractual obligations due to the occurrence of a major case.

Nevertheless, the User hereby grants to the Company a worldwide right to use any content provided by way of the Mobile App for the duration of existence of his/her account on the Mobile App. This right of use shall include, in particular, the Company’s right to reproduce, represent, adapt, translate, modify, digitise, use, or sub-license the User’s contents (information, images, videos, etc.) on any part of the Mobile App and/or in the Company’s mailings and, in general, on all electronic communication media (e-mail, SMS, MMS, WAP, Internet, social networks). Before any reuse of the User’s content within this framework, the Company shall inform the User of the content and the proposed use.

<br>

## 9. THIRD-PARTY WEB SITES
The Mobile App may contain hyperlinks to third-party sites. Links reproduced to these third-party web sites do not imply any approval of these third-party web sites by the Company.

<br>

## 10. APPLICABLE LAW AND ASSIGNMENT OF JURISDICTION
These GTCU are governed by the laws of France.

Choice-of-law rules are excluded in favour of the complete and unreserved application of French law, unless applicable provisions of the User’s country of residence require the application of other rules without the ability to exclude such provisions by contract. 

In the event of a dispute, the User shall have the possibility of resorting to a conventional mediation procedure or any other alternative method of settling disputes. In this regard, the European Commission provides an online dispute resolution platform to which the User can refer here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.

If no agreement is obtained amicably or after mediation, disputes shall be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Paris, France.

However, this clause cannot prevent the User acting in the capacity of a consumer from asserting his/her rights in one of the courts having territorial jurisdiction by virtue of the applicable law of civil procedure or in the jurisdiction of the place where he/she resided at the time of entry into this contract.
